Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install Tractography Meta-Pipeline Command Line Tool (TRAMPOLINO), run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install trampolino

This is the preferred method to install Tractography Meta-Pipeline Command Line Tool (TRAMPOLINO), as it will always install the most recent stable release. Note that TRAMPOLINO is developed in Python 3, so if your system still has both Python 2 and 3, you probably should be running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install trampolino

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
